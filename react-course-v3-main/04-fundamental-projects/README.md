## All My Courses

[Project Based Web Dev Courses](https://www.johnsmilga.com/)

#### Projects

- each project contains final/starter
- final - complete app
- starter - well project starter (our starting point)
  - contains some useful assets : data, css , etc.
- can work in main directory (cd) or remove starter (my preferred method)
- all projects built with VITE (boilerplate)

- install deps

```sh
npm install
```

- spin up dev server

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Steps

- in README.md you will find steps
- you can try to complete the entire app before watching or before each video

Please note that the steps provided are intentionally somewhat vague. The purpose of this challenge is to encourage creative thinking and problem-solving by allowing for multiple possible solutions. Therefore, feel free to interpret these steps in your own way and adapt them to your unique circumstances. Don't be afraid to think outside the box and come up with innovative approaches to the task at hand!


#### Size

- since VITE is way smaller in size, it's less of an issue but still...
- yes, each project is separate entity
- yes, each project contains it's own package.json and node_modules
- I don't keep projects on my local machine
- Github Repo
- Netlify (optional)

#### CSS

- styles provided (index.css)
- css videos optional (at the end of the project)
