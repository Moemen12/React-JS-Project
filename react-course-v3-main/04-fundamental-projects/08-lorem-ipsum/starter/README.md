## Steps

#### Explore Data

Navigate to data.js and explore array

#### Count State Value

In App.jsx, set up a count state value using the useState hook. Set the default value to 1.

#### Form

Set up a form element that contains a number input and a submit button. Attach the count state value to the input using the value prop, and set up a handleChange function to update the count state value when the input changes. Set the minimum value to 1, the maximum value to 8, and the step to 1.

#### Import Text and State Value

Import the text array from data.js and set up a text state value using the useState hook. Set the default value to an empty array.

#### OnSubmit

Attach an onSubmit event to the form, and create a handleSubmit function to handle the form submission. Inside the handleSubmit function, prevent the default form submission behavior using event.preventDefault(). Get the count state value, and use it to create a new array by extracting the first n paragraphs from the text array (where n is the count state value). Set the text state value to the new array.
Hint : I will use array.slice()

#### Render Text

Render the text state value below the form. You will need to use the map method to iterate over the array and render each paragraph. Use the nanoid (more info below) library to generate unique ids for each paragraph.

Overall, the flow of the application should look something like this:

- In App.jsx, set up a count state value using the useState hook.
- Set up a form element that contains a number input and a submit button.
- Import the text array from data.js and set up a text state value using the useState hook.
- Attach an onSubmit event to the form, and create a handleSubmit function to handle the form submission.
- Render the text state value below the form using the map method to iterate over the array and render each paragraph with a unique id generated by the nanoid library.

#### Array.slice()

array.slice is a method in JavaScript that returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object. The slice() method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index of the portion of the array that you want to copy. The starting index is inclusive, meaning the element at the starting index is included in the copied portion, and the ending index is exclusive, meaning the element at the ending index is not included in the copied portion.

Here's an example:

```js
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'];

const slicedFruits = fruits.slice(1, 4); // copies elements 1, 2, and 3 (but not 4) into a new array

console.log(slicedFruits); // ['banana', 'cherry', 'date']
```

In this example, the slice() method is called on the fruits array, with arguments of 1 and 4. This copies elements 1, 2, and 3 of the fruits array into a new array object, which is assigned to the slicedFruits variable. The console.log() statement then outputs the new slicedFruits array to the console.

#### nanoid

nanoid is a small, fast, and secure library for generating unique IDs in JavaScript. It is designed to be as compact as possible while still providing a unique, unpredictable, and collision-resistant identifier.

The library generates random IDs that consist of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as numbers. The default ID length is 21 characters, but this can be changed by passing a different length as an argument.

Here's an example of how to use nanoid to generate a unique ID:

```sh
npm i nanoid
```

```js
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

const id = nanoid(); // Generates a 21-character random ID

console.log(id); // Output: "Uakgb_J5m9g-0JDMbcJqL"
```

In this example, we first import the nanoid function from the nanoid library. We then call the nanoid() function to generate a new, random ID. Finally, we output the ID to the console.

One of the benefits of using nanoid is that it generates IDs that are highly unlikely to collide, even when generating a large number of them. This is achieved by using a combination of randomness and a predefined set of characters, which ensures that each ID is unique and unpredictable.
